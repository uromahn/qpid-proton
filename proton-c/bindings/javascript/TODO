Qpid Proton JavaScript Language Bindings TODO List
==================================================

The code base contains some tweaked emscripten library code, this is ultimately going
to get done properly, commited back to emscripten and removed from here.


The example send-async.c and recv-async.c are both pretty hacky at the moment.

proton-j seems to use hawt-dispatch, which is modelled after Grand Central Dispatch so I need to
work out what it's using it do do and whether there are parallels in proton-c
